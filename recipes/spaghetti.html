    <img src="images/spagetti.jpg" alt="A delicious plate of spaghetti carbonara">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Italian dish is made with spaghetti, bacon, eggs, and cheese. It's a quick and easy meal that's perfect for a weeknight dinner.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest.</li>
      <li>In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat until crispy. Remove from skillet and drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the bacon and toss to combine.</li>
      <li>Remove the skillet from heat and pour in the egg mixture, tossing quickly to coat the pasta. The heat of the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy sauce.</li>
      <li>If the pasta seems dry, add a little reserved pasta water until desired consistency is reached.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately, topped with extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper if desired.</li>
    </ol>
