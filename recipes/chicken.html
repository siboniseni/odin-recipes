    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This creamy pasta dish is made with fettuccine, chicken, cream, and Parmesan cheese. It's a classic Italian-American dish that's sure to please.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound fettuccine</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
      <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cook fettuccine according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water and drain the rest.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add the cream, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked fettuccine to the skillet and toss to combine with the sauce. If the pasta seems dry, add a little reserved pasta water until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately, topped with extra Parmesan cheese and black pepper if desired.</li>
      </ol>
